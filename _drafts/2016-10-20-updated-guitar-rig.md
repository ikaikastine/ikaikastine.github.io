### Updated Pedalboard   
For my birthday, my wonderful wife gifted me with a new pedal: the Boss DD-20 Giga Delay.
This pedal has replaced my Flashback as my main delay pedal.
The DD-20 is an awesome delay pedal with tons of functionality. Ive been using the following settings:   

1. Light tape delay on the dotted-eighth setting
..* Used mainly for filling in the space behind my notes
2. Medium standard delay on the quarter note setting
..* Used on songs that use quarter note delay. Repeats sit well when doing lead lines
3. Heavy tape delay on the dotted-eight setting
..* Used for a heavier dotted eighth sound, similar to The Edge. 
4. Heavy tape delay on the dotted-eight setting with high feedback and mix
..* Used for ambient swells    

I havent had too much time to really sit down and test out all the features of this pedal, but so far I love it.
Most of the sounds I use center around the tape, analog, and standard modes. One day Ill take the time to explore all the modes.

You might notice that my Flashback is still on the board.
I like to stack this pedal in modulate mode with the DD-20 to create some really spaced out ambient pads.
