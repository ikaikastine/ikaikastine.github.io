My name is Kevin Stine. I'm 21 years old from the San Fransisco Bay Area.
Currently I live in Corvallis, Oregon where I'm studying Computer Science at
Oregon State University. I'm also the lead electric guitar player for
Mosaic Church, a new church plant in Eugene Oregon. You can check us out at
[Mosaic Eugene](http://mosaiceugene.com/).

### Tech
As a Computer Scientist, I love technology and all things tech related. I really
enjoy learning new programming languages and discovering the various nuances
between different languages. One of the main reasons I'm writing this now is to
get more familiar with HTML and CSS, as well as to utilize Jekyll. In addition,
it's taken me some time to get Travis CI set up on this repository, so I've
been able to learn a little about Ruby in the process.

Feel free to check out my Github page to see any projects or things that I've
been working on which can be found at
