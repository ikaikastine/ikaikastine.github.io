My name is Kevin Stine. I'm 21 years old from the San Fransisco Bay Area.
Currently I live in Corvallis, Oregon where I'm studying Computer Science at
Oregon State University. I'm currently the lead electric guitar player for
Mosaic Church, a new church plant in Eugene Oregon.

### Guitar
I love guitar, specifically electric. I've been playing for about 10 years,
and while that is a long time, I would by no means say I'm an expert. I'm
currently into playing Praise & Worship style music and have been learning
to layer effects together to create those lush soundscapes you hear in modern
P&W music.

#### My Gear
Guitar - PRS SE Singlecut with D'Addario NYXL 10s  
Amp - Vox AC15 with stock tubes  
Effects:

* MXR DynaComp
* TC Electronics PolyTune 2 Mini
* Electro Harmonix Soul Food
* Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive
* Ernie Ball VP JR.
* TC Electronics Flashback Delay
* TC Electronics Hall of Fame Reverb

### Tech
As a Computer Scientist, I love technology and all things tech related. I really
enjoy learning new programming languages and discovering the various nuances
between different languages. One of the main reasons I'm writing this now is to
get more familiar with html and css, as well as to utilize Jekyll. In addition,
it's taken me some time to get Travis CI set up on this repository, so I've
been able to learn a little about Ruby in the process.
