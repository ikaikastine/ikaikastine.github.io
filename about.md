My name is Kevin Stine. I'm 21 years old from the San Fransisco Bay Area.
Currently I live in Corvallis, Oregon where I'm studying Computer Science at
Oregon State University. I'm currently the lead electric guitar player for
Mosaic Church, a new church plant in Eugene Oregon.

### Guitar
I love guitar, specifically electric. I've been playing for about 10 years,
and while that is a long time, I would by no means say I'm an expert. My early
years of guitar playing were focused around playing pop-punk songs and bands
such as blink-182, Yellowcard, etc. As my skills and guitar knowledge increased,
I began to focus more on playing heavier things, jumping into the post-hardcore,
metalcore, and heavy rock genres.

Currently, as I've got more invested in playing for church, I've drifted away
from the heavy genres and focused more on Prayer & Worship styles of music. This
has been quite the learning curve for me as I'm used to playing with heavily
distorted tones. Now I focus on clean or slightly overdriven tones, layered with
delay and reverb.

#### My Gear
Guitar - PRS SE Singlecut with D'Addario NYXL 10s  
Amp - Vox AC15 with stock tubes
