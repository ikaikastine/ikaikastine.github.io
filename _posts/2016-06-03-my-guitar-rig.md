## My Guitar Rig
I love guitar, specifically electric. I've been playing for about 10 years,
and while that is a long time, I would by no means say I'm an expert. I'm
currently into playing Praise & Worship style music and have been learning
to layer effects together to create those lush soundscapes you hear in modern
P&W music.

### My Gear
Guitar - PRS SE Singlecut  
Amp - Vox AC15 with JJ EL84s and stock 12AX7s  
Strings - D'Addario NYXL 11's  

Pedals (In order or signal chain):

* MXR DynaComp
* TC Electronics PolyTune 2 Mini
* Electro Harmonix Soul Food
* Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive
* Ernie Ball VP JR.
* TC Electronics Flashback Delay
* TC Electronics Hall of Fame Reverb
